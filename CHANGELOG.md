# Changelog

This changelog records public product changes. For the authoritative description
of current runtime behavior, see [`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The Overpass proxy now rotates to the next mirror on any non-2xx upstream
  response, not only on 5xx. `overpass-api.de` and its `lz4` alias answer 406 to
  the proxy's User-Agent while two of the configured mirrors answer 200 to the
  identical request, so the fan-out stopped at the first refusal with healthy
  mirrors untried. The refusal was also cached to memory and disk and served as
  data — boundary-class queries hold a month-long TTL — which affected every
  Overpass-backed feature: road geometry, annotation outlines and place lookup.
- Existing cached refusals are now ignored immediately, including during
  stale-data fallback. Concurrent identical requests share the same last-good
  fallback when all mirrors refuse, without duplicating upstream requests.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-01 — Installation and live-data fixes

### Changed

- Tightened the README opening around keyless setup, source freshness, modeled
  experiences, and the accessibility of the provider stack.

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-31 — One-click install, keyless boot, Provider Settings

### Changed
- Historical setup in that release used a provider ladder of zero keys → free
  Cesium ion (eligible personal, non-commercial use) → billing-enabled Google
  Maps. The current runtime uses Azure Maps with an OSM fallback.
- Browser-built data modules no longer import `node:fs`; a repo-wide boundary
  scan test keeps it that way (#83 — thanks @ethanstoner).
- Aircraft-identity voice answers explicitly cover operator, type, and route,
  and say so plainly when enrichment is unavailable instead of guessing.

### Security
- Provider Settings answers only local, unproxied requests and disables itself
  entirely whenever the server is shared. Public datacenter and dam datasets
  omit contact-oriented fields (see the dataset READMEs).

## Pre-release development history

The dated entries and internal milestone numbers below predate the first
tagged GitHub Release. They are retained as project history and do not
represent previously published GitHub Releases.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-24

### Added

- Added honest aircraft identity narration: callsign, operator, registration,
  type, and route come only from selected-contact context, and missing operator,
  route, or type enrichment is named explicitly.
- Added local, publication-compatible copies of the two README PNGs, with source
  records and third-party-license boundaries in `docs/media/README.md`.
- Added regression coverage for aircraft identity narration and optional-key
  loading feedback.

### Changed

- First-run presentation now opens with Detection `DENSE` at 75%, `ELASTIC`
  allocation, Fade 7%, Outside 1%, scope feather 11%, and aircraft 3D models in
  `PROXIMITY`. Stored state and share links still override these baselines.
- At that point, 17 selected README GIFs were documented separately from the
  two owner-published PNGs; removed-feature captures were deleted later.
- Bundled datacenter and dam snapshots now omit contact-oriented fields and
  note values containing email or phone identifiers. Feature geometry, names,
  operator/capacity/river metadata, counts, and ODbL terms are unchanged.
- Public documentation and the L9 release matrix no longer reference non-public
  planning material or repository history.

### Fixed

- A missing optional FIRMS key no longer turns the complete Environmental
  mission into `LOAD FAILED`. The FIRMS row still reports `KEY REQUIRED`, while
  earthquakes continue to load. Real lifecycle and fetch failures retain
  failure priority.
- The mapped-installations layer retries after an unavailable request when it is
  enabled or the camera settles.
- Aircraft trails attach to the rendered aircraft transform and remain near the
  rear center across headings. Parked aircraft do not draw a moving head
  segment.
- Grounded aircraft keep validated floor evidence through temporary terrain
  outages and wait for measured rendered-surface evidence before a 3D model
  takes over from its billboard.
- The now-removed aircraft view used aviation MSL data rather than Cesium
  render height.

### Security

- Production transitive dependencies resolve to patched DOMPurify and
  protobufjs releases without changing the Cesium version or application APIs.
- Production dependency audit reports no known advisories; remaining audit
  findings are confined to development and QA tooling.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-23

### Added

### Changed

- Environmental consistently presents both earthquakes and NASA FIRMS fires,
  with honest optional-key degradation.
- The tracked aircraft trail acceptance bar is visual: roughly rear-center,
  stable across headings, with minor hull overlap allowed and no conspicuous
  top, bottom, or lateral projection.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-18 to 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added the original Map Source tray, share-link v2 state, aircraft-view/context
  voice parity, MSL altitude readouts, and close-range tracked aircraft models.
- Added the L9 release-candidate matrix, AIS feed watchdog, voice cost controls,
  satellite classes, and the shared world-overlay host.
- Added deterministic first-run, map-source, floor, overlay, tracking, and
  aircraft-model regression harnesses.

### Changed

- Consolidated world labels, cards, tracked readouts, CCTV thumbnails, cable
  labels, mission labels, and detection presentation under shared allocation and
  lifecycle rules.
- Reduced idle rendering through the render governor and explicit scope mask.
- Improved the former aircraft-view layout, context restoration, feed honesty, and
  aircraft 2D/3D handoffs.

### Fixed

- Fixed degenerate depth picks, map-source restore states, route-camera motion,
  bright-ground label readability, grounded display flooring, and cross-layer
  tracking cleanup.
- Fixed stale overlay callbacks, parked-idle render leaks, cable-label sweep
  starvation, and several share-link state conflicts.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-08-02 to 2026-08-16

### Added

### Changed

- Unified right-side product controls and responsive aircraft-view/map layouts.
- Migrated public-safe neighborhood geometry to DataSF and tightened safe local
  development defaults.
- Improved proxy resilience, annotation outline bounds, CCTV enable pacing,
  contact de-emphasis, and deterministic visual stacking.

## [Unreleased] — July 2026

### Added

- Added live NASA FIRMS fires, optional live TomTom traffic, Caltrans and TfL
  CCTV packs, CCTV viewsheds and direct-manipulation calibration, citywide CCTV
  cards, Natural Earth regions, analyst queries, and voice routing QA.
- Added the end-to-end vertical-datum system for aircraft, vessels, CCTV,
  annotations, trails, and terrain-aware rendering.
- Added aircraft class silhouettes, path-derived display heading, ADSBDB
  enrichment, cached CelesTrak TLE lookup, and next-ISS-pass prediction.

### Fixed

- Fixed elevated-airport aircraft placement, vessel sea-surface placement,
  close-zoom FIRMS anchors, antimeridian region framing, annotation resolution,
  cross-layer tracking ownership, and CCTV projection lifecycle issues.

## [Unreleased] — June 2026

### Added

- Added the original OpenAI Realtime voice control (later replaced by Microsoft
  Foundry), scene-aware entity context, viewport image grounding, the AI HUD
  summary, live AIS vessels, infrastructure layers, map source switching,
  free-text navigation, and server-side data proxies.
- Added hybrid map annotations, 3D aircraft, panoptic detection, tracking
  harnesses, and public data attribution.
- Added MIT source licensing, security guidance, contribution guidance, data
  source notices, and third-party asset boundaries.

### Changed

- Removed the experimental AI video-edit style and retained seven deterministic
  visual styles.
- Moved Realtime text-history trimming to the server-side retention policy while
  keeping only the latest viewport image in conversation context.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-18

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-10

- Added the initial multi-layer 3D globe experience, visual styles, live
  aircraft, satellites, earthquakes, CCTV, traffic, FIRMS, infrastructure, and
  performance controls.
- Added entity inspection, tracking, scenes, keyboard controls, and shareable
  views.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-09

- Initial project version.
