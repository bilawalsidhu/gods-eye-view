## Open

### Street traffic can be slow/uneven when panning across dense city blocks
Status: Resolved / Mitigated (shipped 2026-09-12)

Context:
- Traffic loader previously fetched one clamped viewport tile at a time without viewport prioritization or adjacent tile prefetching.
- In dense cores, peripheral roads could consume the dot budget before central downtown streets spawned, and rapid panning across city blocks could cause delayed street coverage.

Resolved mitigations:
- **Active viewport road prioritization**: Roads intersecting `getViewBounds()` and closest to `getFetchCenter()` are prioritized first in dot budget allocation and spawn loops (`src/data/trafficBounds.js`, `src/data/traffic.js`).
- **Neighbor ring prefetch**: When primary tile finishes loading below `FAST_FETCH_ALTITUDE`, background prefetching queues adjacent cardinal/diagonal neighbor tiles into `_tileCache` (quiet 150ms intervals; cancelled on camera pan/jump).
- **Adaptive dot cap by frame time**: Tracks smoothed frame delta in `animate()` and adaptively scales dot primitives between 3,000 and 6,000 (coverage first, density second) under frame drop pressure (>22ms) while restoring 60 FPS headroom.
- **Multi-phase sync chip progress**: Exposes `phaseProgressPct` (25% syncing major network, 65% loading local streets, 85% matching traffic flow, 95% prewarming road grid, 100% idle) and `phaseLabel` to drive `#traffic-sync-chip` multi-phase feedback.

### CCTV panel can appear "missing" after layout refactors
Status: Open (workaround available)

Context:
- Panel positions are persisted in local storage and can restore off-screen after UI changes.

Workaround:
- In browser console:
  - `localStorage.removeItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelPos.cctv-panel');`
  - `localStorage.removeItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.cctv-panel');`
  - `location.reload();`

Related keys (current versions):
- Panel positions: `godsEyeView.v7.panelPos.<panel-id>` (re-versioned 2026-06-10)
- Panel collapsed state: `godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.<panel-id>`
- CCTV calibration: `godsEyeView.cctv.calibration.v2`

### Height-datum residuals (branch `feat/height-datum`, pending merge)
Status: Open (owner-accepted 2026-07-08, documented)

- **Cold-start floor latency:** at a freshly-visited airport, grounded/low aircraft
  float low for ~1–2 poll cycles (30–60 s) and rise as terrain floors resolve;
  a few stragglers take one more poll.
- **Born-grounded first poll:** a contact first seen on the ground with no altitude
  data renders at the geoid for ≤1 poll until its floor cell warms.
- Full context, improvement ideas, and the verification oracle
  (`scripts/qa-floor-verify.mjs`):
  `docs/superpowers/reports/2026-07-08-height-datum-handover.md`.

## Closed / Intentional (for clarity)

### Proxy SSRF and error-surface hardening gaps
Status: Closed as fixed on `main`

Context:
- Proxy middleware previously allowed broader error/internal surface area and looser upstream handling.
- Current `main` includes hardened proxy behavior in `vite.config.js`:
  - CCTV upstream URL no longer accepted from client query params.
  - Error payloads are sanitized.
  - OpenSky cache stores successful responses only.
  - OpenSky token refresh is coalesced.
  - GBFS/CCTV memory growth is bounded.

Validation target:
- `vite.config.js`

---

### NVG vignette edge color bleed
Status: Closed as fixed in current shader composite

Context:
- Earlier builds leaked original scene colors near the NVG tube edge.
- Current composite now masks NVG output with tube falloff before final blend, removing the color edge bleed.

Validation target:
- `src/styles/surveillance.js`

### Wildfires layer unavailable / static bundled snapshot
Status: Closed — live FIRMS integration shipped (2026-07-16)

Context:
- Wildfires (NASA FIRMS) were removed from runtime in v0.5.3, returned June 2026 as a
  bundled-snapshot layer (`local-firms`, 2026-05-25 data, ~58 MB in-repo), and were
  converted to **live NASA FIRMS data** on 2026-07-16: the `/api/firms` proxy merges
  three VIIRS NRT sources (trailing 24 h, 30 min cache, serve-stale-on-failure) and the
  bundled snapshot was deleted. Requires a free server-side `FIRMS_MAP_KEY`; without it
  the layer shows a KEY REQUIRED state.
- Weather radar is still held out of OSS v1 after QA found the previous overlay did not provide reliable visible value.
