# Test fixtures

- `tomtom-flow-austin-12-935-1686.pbf` — one real TomTom traffic-flow vector
  tile (Mapbox Vector Tile protobuf, layer `"Traffic flow"`), downtown Austin
  z12 x935 y1686, captured 2026-07-16 from
  `api.tomtom.com/traffic/map/4/tile/flow/relative/12/935/1686.pbf`
  (22,980 bytes). Used by offline decode/source tests and the explicit `qa-traffic --fixtures`
  browser mode — it is a point-in-time congestion snapshot, not a bundled
  data layer, and is never loaded by ordinary application startup. © TomTom.
- `adsb-austin-frames.txt` — 112 raw Mode S frames (`*<hex>;`, one per line,
  in receive order) received over Austin, TX, and
  `adsb-austin-dump1090-aircraft.json` — dump1090-fa's `aircraft.json` decode
  of the same frames, trimmed to the fields the tests assert on. Used by the
  Local ADS-B decoder and record-adapter tests; never loaded at runtime.
